### About this project  
This is a personal learning project created to explore how data analytics can be applied in e-commerce.  
Using the Olist dataset, I practiced combining SQL and R to analyze seller KPIs, and presented the insights through an interactive dashboard.  
The goal was to better understand marketplace dynamics and sharpen my skills in real-world data storytelling.
